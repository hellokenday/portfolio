      <p>
        Switchback is an iOS app that can help mountain bikers share their riding experiences. Cyclists can track their rides, publish trail information, and organise events like races or dig days.

      <h3 class="mb-3">My role</h3>
      <p>
        Since this was my final year project, I worked through most of the product design process from research to develop a prototype using PhoneGap. This process also included UX/UI, competitor analysis, creating personas, story mapping, wireframing, prototyping, and developing a design persona.
      </p>

    <!-- problem -->

      <h3 class="mb-3">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        As a mountain biker, I’ve used many cycling apps. These products provide statistics based on data logged during each cycle with the aim of encouraging solo training and healthy competition. Although these products have benefited cycling performance and fitness, they can have a negative impact on mountain biking culture.  
        <br><br>
        Based on my research these apps can influence riders to adopt an overly competitive mindset, resulting in a disregard for other cyclists who are not competing against track times or striving for leaderboard positions. As well as creating an antisocial riding style, one of the main issues is that they publish trail GPS data online, which often results in the overuse or closure of privately built bike trails.
      </p>

    <!-- solution -->
    <div class="section mt-md-7 mt-6 mb-md-7">
      <h3 class="mb-3">Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Encourage mountain bikers to compete in a more responsible manner by educating them in trail etiquette and how to use unsanctioned bike trails to avoid their closure. Bring together the biking community by allowing them to organise events and socialise through a platform.

      <h3 class="mb-3">Research</h3>
      <p>
        After interviews and survey research I defined two types of user the app should target. Each persona embodies the pain points and goals of the potential users who were studied as well as design requirements gathered after performing a heuristic analysis on competing apps.

    <div class="section mt-md-7 mt-6 mb-md-7">
      <h3 class="mb-3">Design Persona</h3>
      <p>
        Once user stories and requirements were defined, I had enough information to flesh out a personality of the application. This personality embodied the app’s interface design with the purpose of creating an engaging experience for the intended user group. The Design persona is an archetypal character designed to be like-minded to the user personas. If successful the user will feel like they are interacting with a friend when using Switchback and not just an application.

      <p>
        User stories were mapped to identify the scope of the project and what needed to be implemented. Although the most important stories were defined during prioritisation, the five stories I chose to implement were not the highest in priority. The chosen stories included features that could be implemented in the given time frame, required a manageable amount of effort, and would still give meaning to the application.

      <p>
        Initial ideas and sketches were drawn up quickly to ensure concepts were developed in a short space of time. This allowed several ideas to be thought through before committing to wireframes and helped draw out ideas for the project vision. Once ideas were chosen, they were wireframed and rapid prototyped for testing. The wireframes in the second image represent the user’s goal of avoiding trail closures.

      <p>
        I carried out a usability test of the prototype which provided insights into the thoughts and behaviours of my target user group, with the aim of eliciting recommendations for a redesign. Each user was given a task where on completion they filled out a Likert scale and answered questions. The participant’s ability to complete the tasks and time taken was recorded. 
        <br><br>
        All of the participants found the wireframe prototype to be well organised, quick to learn how to use, easy to navigate, and easy to use. Having clearly labelled navigation icons and tab-selected states was a key recommendation.

        The interface design reflected the recommendations for improvement drawn out from the usability evaluation of the prototype and attempted to embody the personality created in the design persona.
        <br><br>
        The wireframes representing the user stories were elaborated using Photoshop, producing graphical mock-ups that added aesthetic detail to the designs. Designing the application in this way also provided an art direction that helped during the front-end development stage.

      <p>
        The app was built using Appgyver, a hybrid web app framework that allows web technology to be deployed on a native mobile platform like iOS or Android. This allowed me to build an MVP relatively quickly with no understanding of native app development. This video shows an iOS simulator running my app build where a ride is being recorded.

      <p>
        The record a ride functionality of the application was usability evaluated, bringing forward good results with some recommendations for improvement. The interface design was successful as it embodied aspects of a mountain biker’s personality which users found delightful. Although I wasn’t able to test the product’s influence on mountain bikers, it allowed me to take ownership of a project which I thoroughly enjoyed.
