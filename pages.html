        Claromentis is a digital workspace that helps teams share files, communicate, and work together. The Pages application allows users to build their pages from a library of widgets and customise them for their workspace.

      <h3 class="mb-3">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        As the only designer on the project, I worked on the concepts, UX/UI, design patterns, onboarding, and front-end development alongside engineers in the product team. After creating two web prototypes, I performed A/B testing to identify the most usable design to continue developing as our MVP.

    <!-- problem -->
    <div class="section mt-md-7 mt-6 mb-md-7">
      <h3 class="mb-3">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        We were customising versions of our core product to satisfy design requirements from different clients. With a growing client base, it became impossible to maintain our product as well as the custom variations. We also accumulated design/technical debt having a library of shared components with entirely different styles and code bases being used across our products.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-3">Goal</h4>
      <p>Reduce design debt and stop creating custom versions of our product for different clients.</p>

      <p>
        Provide users with the ability to build and customise their digital workspaces and create a shared design pattern to be used across our products. Any customisations applied for existing clients should be possible in the new application.

        I worked with our customer service team to uncover insights by studying user feedback and issues logged on our existing page builder called Publish. This research helped translate ideas into features that address user expectations and helped resolve their pain points. I then created wireframes and rapid prototypes which were user tested to validate ideas. Later mockups and design specs for our engineers were produced after a design concept was chosen.

      <h3 class="mb-3">Design</h3>
      <p>
        Findings from the user research showed that Publish was challenging to use. The main issues included a lack of feedback when performing actions and it required knowledge of HTML to build pages. We solved these issues by providing users with clear dialogues to prevent errors and by designing a drag &amp; drop interface with customisable components.

      <h3 class="mb-3">Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        After working through a short design sprint, we chose two concepts that we would develop further into HTML prototypes to test the drag &amp; drop interactions. A sidebar design which has a component library on the left side and a contextual design that uses progressive disclosure to reveal a popover library where components can be added from a section of the page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- test -->
    <div class="section mt-md-7 mt-6 mb-md-7">
      <h3 class="mb-3">Test</h3>
      <p>
        We carried out usability testing on each of the designs to see which performed better and to test two assumptions. 
      </p>
      <ol class="mt-3">
        <li>
          <span class="font-italic">
            Would using drag &amp; drop to place components from a sidebar frustrate users?
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-italic">
            Would users be able to find the component library in the contextual design?
          </span>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          Participants were asked to complete three tasks where success, speed, and satisfaction were measured.
          <br><br>
          Overall, both prototypes were successful, but the contextual design was rated as more satisfying in post-interview questions. Although the initial time to discover the component library was much higher than the sidebar design, once users knew how to add components they were much faster at creating pages with the contextual design.

      <p>
        We went on to develop an MVP of the contextual design which we shipped to a small sample group before releasing to our clients. Below is the product after iterating over several rounds of feedback. Users can change the layout of their dashboard, add/remove components, and publish their changes live.

      <p>
        Pages had a positive impact on our product. We no longer support custom interfaces which eliminated a large amount of design/technical debt. There are a couple of features that could be added to improve the product, including onboarding and implementing the design menu for more usable navigation.
