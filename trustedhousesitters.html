        TrustedHouseistters is a house and pet sitting platform for people to look after pets in exchange for a place to stay. Home and pet owners open their homes to pet sitters who want to travel and live like locals. The product can be accessed from its website or mobile app for iOS and Android. 
        <br><br>
        The new web experience is currently being developed as an MVP and is being distributed to sample groups for testing before its full release.

      <p>
      I joined the company as the first product designer to work on redesigning the web experience. This involved usability evaluation of the product to gather design requirements, creating a design system, carrying out design sprints to validate ideas before moving into agile sprints, and working with our UX researcher to gather insights for personas.

      <h3 class="mb-3">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Usability testing of the website revealed that first-time visitors did not understand the service, which we assumed was affecting conversion rates/membership sales.
        <br><br>
        Several problem areas were uncovered: 
      </p>
      
      <ol class="mt-3">
        <li>
          No understanding of how the service works
          <ul>
            <li>
              participants did not have enough information before signing up
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3">
          Confusion with the membership pricing model
          <ul>
            <li>
              participants thought that sitters get paid to house sit

        </li>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Questions &amp; Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        The problem areas revealed by testing left us with questions and ideas for solutions:  
      </p>
      
      <ol class="mt-3">
        <li>
          How might we get across how our service works before people go to sign-up?
        </li>
        <li>
          How might we explain that sitters sit for free in exchange for accommodation?
        </li>
        <li>
          How might we ensure people feel they can trust our service and be comfortable letting strangers into their homes?
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p class="mt-3">Based on those questions, we thought of these solutions:</p>
      
      <ol class="mt-3">
        <li>
          Showing information about how the service works on the home and search pages
        </li>
        <li>
          Directing users on the home and search pages to information about pricing
        </li>
        <li>
          Directing users to information about our safety verifications and code of conduct
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Process</h3>
      <p>
        I worked with our customer service team to uncover insights by studying user feedback and issues logged on our existing page builder called Publish. This helped translate ideas into features that address user expectations and helped resolve their pain points. Following a similar design sprint to Jake Knapp, I created wireframes and rapid prototypes which were user tested to validate ideas. Later mockups and design specs for our engineers were produced after a design concept was chosen.

      <h3 class="mb-3">Design</h3>
      <p>
        Findings from the user research showed that Publish was difficult to use. The main issues included a lack of feedback when performing actions and it required knowledge of HTML to build pages. We solved these issues by providing users with clear dialogues to prevent errors and by designing a drag &amp; drop interface with customisable components.

      <h3 class="mb-3">Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        After ideating over a five-day design sprint we chose two concepts that we would develop further into HTML prototypes to test the drag &mp; drop interactions. A sidebar design which has a component library on the left side and a contextual design that uses progressive disclosure to reveal a popover library where components can be added from a section of the page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <img data-src="images/pages/prototype@2x.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-md-0 mt-6 lazy-load" alt="image">
    
    <!-- test -->
    <div class="section mt-md-7 mt-6 mb-md-7">
      <h3 class="mb-3">Test</h3>
      <p>
        We carried out usability testing on each of the designs to see which performed better and to test two assumptions. Firstly, would using drag &mp; drop to repeatedly place components from a sidebar frustrate users? Secondly, would users be able to find the component library in the contextual design? Participants were asked to complete three tasks where success, speed, and satisfaction were measured. 
        <br><br>
        Overall, both prototypes were successful but the contextual design was rated as more satisfying in post-interview questions. Although the initial time to discover the component library was much greater than the sidebar design, once users knew how to add components they were much faster at creating pages with the contextual design.

        We went on to develop an MVP of the contextual design which we shipped to a small sample group before releasing to our clients. Below is the product after iterating over several rounds of feedback. Users can change the layout of their dashboard, add/remove components, and publish their changes live.

      <p>
        Pages had a positive impact on our product. We no longer support custom interfaces which eliminated a large amount of design/technical debt. There are a couple of features that could be added to improve the product, including onboarding and implementing the design menu for more usable navigation.
