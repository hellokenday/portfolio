      <p>
        TrustedHousesitters is a house and pet sitting platform for people to look after pets in exchange for a place to stay.
        <br><br>
        The iOS app user onboarding helps new pet sitters create quality profiles to ensure enough information is included for them to succeed in securing their first house sit.

        A percentage of new sitters don't succeed in getting a housesit in their first three months of becoming a member which leads to refunds or discontinued memberships if they don't succeed at all.

      <p>Increase pet sitter success ensuring new members get a house sit in their first three months of signing up to the service.</p>

      <p>Increase new pet sitters success over the next six months (>10%).</p>

            <h4>Ask the experts</h4>
            <p>
              We interviewed experts on the sprint team and from other areas of the business - asking about anything related to the journey map: the vision, how things work, and previous efforts. This information continued to inform the map and the goals.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-3">Take How Might We notes</h4>
            <p>
              While experts were interviewed, each sprint member took notes on any paint points or insights they heard and positively reframed them as open-ended questions. "The How Might We" method ensures teams look for opportunities rather than jumping to solutions or get bogged down by problems.
            </p>

            <p class="font-italic mt-3">
              An interesting insight we heard from a customer champion informed us that new pet sitters weren't adding enough information to their profiles to be appealing to homeowners.

            <h4>Organise How Might We Notes</h4>
            <p>
              Once we finished the expert interviews, all How Might We notes were gathered and stuck onto a wall where we physically grouped them into similar themes. Each group was labelled, and notes were sorted enough to move on to prioritisation. This exercise followed Affinity Mapping.
            </p>

            <p class="font-italic mt-3">
              We had 14 total groups after sorting the notes, where many opportunities were labelled under the themes of Education, Matchmaking, and Completing Profiles.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-3">Vote on How Might We Notes</h4>
            <p>
              To highlight areas of emphasis to consider for the rest of the sprint, we voted on which How Might We opportunities we felt were most important. Each sprint member made two votes represented by dots they added to the sticky notes they liked.

              After the voting was over, we took the How Might We notes with the most votes and placed them on our map. The notes corresponded with specific areas on the map narrowing down areas of focus for the sprint. Lisa, our decider then circled the most important customer and one target moment on our map.

              We spent 20 minutes silently walking around the room and gathering notes. Note taking allowed the team to review the goals, opportunities, and inspiration collected and prepared us to translate our ideas into visual sketches.

              <p>
                Once everyone had reviewed all of the information and made notes, each member jotted down rough ideas on a sheet of paper. The ideas can take any shape such as doodles, headlines, sketches - anything which enables thoughts to form into ideas.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Crazy 8s allowed us to take our strongest ideas and sketch them into eight variations in just eight minutes. We started by folding a piece of paper into eight sections then sketched one idea in each panel every minute.  
              </p>

                Finally, we each took our best idea for the solution and sketched it out in a three-panel storyboard format because "products and services are more like movies than snapshots."

            <h4>Sticky decision</h4>
            <p>
              We couldn't prototype and test all of our solutions - we needed one combined plan, so we followed a five-step process for deciding on the best idea.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="mt-4">
              <span class="muted">Step 1:</span> Art museum
            </h4>
            <p>
              We hung all the solution sketches on a wall so everyone could take a look at them.
            </p>

            <div class="collapse" id="collapseWedsOne">

              </h4>
              <p>
                Silently, we looked at a solution sketch and used sticky dots to vote on features we thought were worth prototyping.
              </p>

              <h4 class="mt-4">
                <span class="muted">Step 3:</span> Speed critique
              </h4>
              <p>
                We then spent 3 minutes per sketch discussing the highlights of each solution, taking notes on standout ideas.
              </p>

              <h4 class="mt-4">
                <span class="muted">Step 4:</span> Speed critique
              </h4>
              <p>
                To collect the group's opinions, we each silently voted on ideas we liked the most using large sticky dots. 
              </p>

              <h4 class="mt-4">
                <span class="muted">Step 5:</span> Supervote
              </h4>
              <p>
                With all the votes in place, Lisa our decider voted on three final solutions we continued to prototype and test.
