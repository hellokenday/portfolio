      <p>
        TrustedHousesitters is a house and pet sitting platform for people to look after pets in exchange for a place to stay.
        <br><br>
        The iOS app user onboarding helps new pet sitters create quality profiles to ensure enough information is included for them to succeed in securing their first house sit.

            <h4>Ask the experts</h4>
            <p>
              We interviewed experts on the sprint team and from other areas of the business - asking about anything related to the journey map: the vision, how things work, and previous efforts. This information continued to inform the map and the goals.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-3">Take How Might We notes</h4>
            <p>
              While experts were interviewed, each sprint member took notes on any paint points or insights they heard and positively reframed them as open-ended questions. "The How Might We" method ensures teams look for opportunities rather than jumping to solutions or get bogged down by problems.
            </p>

            <p class="font-italic mt-3">
              An interesting insight we heard from a customer champion informed us that new pet sitters weren't adding enough information to their profiles to be appealing to homeowners.

              Once we finished the expert interviews, all How Might We notes were gathered and stuck onto a wall where we physically grouped them into similar themes. Each group was labelled, and notes were sorted enough to move on to prioritisation. This exercise followed Affinity Mapping.
            </p>

            <p class="font-italic mt-3">
              We had 14 total groups after sorting the notes, where many opportunities were labelled under the themes of Education, Matchmaking, and Completing Profiles.

              <p>
                To highlight areas of emphasis to consider for the rest of the sprint, we voted on which How Might We opportunities we felt were most important. Each sprint member made two votes represented by dots they added to the sticky notes they liked.

The notes corresponded with specific areas on the map narrowing down areas of focus for the sprint. Lisa, our decider then circled the most important customer and one target moment on our map.

        While the project is still ongoing, we have continued to iterate the designs based on the observed patterns and validated new ideas using remote user testing. This approach allowed us to gain immediate qualitative feedback while the time invested in the end product is proportionally low. Results have been very positive with users as we have ironed out most issues.
      </p>
     
      <h5 class="mt-4">Next steps</h5>
      <p>
        The next step is to finalise the onboarding experience and to continually iterate based on user feedback. Once the onboarding feature is rolled out, we will keep track of quantitative data to measure the impact it has had on pet sitter success.
