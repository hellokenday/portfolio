      <p>
        TrustedHousesitters is a house and pet sitting platform for people to look after pets in exchange for a place to stay.
        <br><br>
        The iOS app user onboarding helps new pet sitters create quality profiles to ensure enough information is included for them to succeed in securing their first house sit.

      <h4 class="mt-4">My role</h4> 
      <p>As a designer on the sprint team, I focused on the prototype design as well as facilitating some of the usability testing and user interviews.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Problem</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        A percentage of new sitters don't succeed in getting a housesit in their first three months of becoming a member which leads to refunds or discontinued memberships if they don't succeed at all.

      <h4 class="mt-4">Goal</h4>
      <p>Increase pet sitter success ensuring new members get a house sit in their first three months of signing up to the service.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Success metrics</h4> 
      <p>Increase new pet sitters success over the next six months (>10%).</p>

      <p>
        We decided to run a Google-style design sprint to come up with validated solutions. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="font-italic">
          The Design Sprint is a process for solving problems through research, designing, prototyping and testing ideas with users.

        <br><br>
        The process follows six phases: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate.

          <h4>Ask the experts</h4>
          <p>
            We interviewed experts on the sprint team and from other areas of the business - asking about anything related to the journey map: the vision, how things work, and previous efforts. This information continued to inform the map and the goals.

          <p>
            While experts were interviewed, each sprint member took notes on any paint points or insights they heard and positively reframed them as open-ended questions. "The How Might We" method ensures teams look for opportunities rather than jumping to solutions or get bogged down by problems.
